1. Access your application routes in OpenShift:

  {{/*
    Set route name using the Helm release fullname helper.
    Assumes the active Route is named "{{ fullname }}-route"
    and the preview Route is named "{{ fullname }}-preview"
  */}}

  Active Route:
    export ACTIVE_ROUTE=$(oc get route -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} {{ include "rolloutdemo.fullname" . }} -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
    echo "http://$ACTIVE_ROUTE"

  {{/*
    Preview Route is typically used in BlueGreen deployments for pre-promotion testing.
    Assumes the preview Route is named "{{ fullname }}-preview"
  */}}

  Preview Route:
    export PREVIEW_ROUTE=$(oc get route -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} {{ include "rolloutdemo.fullname" . }}-preview -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
    echo "http://$PREVIEW_ROUTE"

  {{/*
    These commands retrieve the external hostnames for the Route resources and output the full URLs.
    Ensure the Routes exist and your rollout strategy is configured to create both.
  */}}
