{{/*
  NOTES.txt is rendered and shown after a successful Helm install or upgrade.
  This version is customized for standard Kubernetes environments (not OpenShift),
  and assumes your BlueGreen rollout uses separate Services for active and preview traffic.
*/}}

1. Access your application endpoints (in-cluster):

  {{/*
    These assume your service is exposed internally within the cluster and
    the service names follow the format:
    - {{ fullname }}-active
    - {{ fullname }}-preview
  */}}

  Active Service:
    echo "http://{{ include "rolloutdemo.fullname" . }}-active.{{ .Release.Namespace }}:{{ .Values.service.port }}"

  Preview Service:
    echo "http://{{ include "rolloutdemo.fullname" . }}-preview.{{ .Release.Namespace }}:{{ .Values.service.port }}"

  {{/*
    If you have Traefik or a LoadBalancer exposing these services externally,
    you may replace these with the external hostname or port-forward commands.
  */}}

2. To port-forward and access locally (example for preview):

    kubectl port-forward svc/{{ include "rolloutdemo.fullname" . }}-preview -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} {{ .Values.service.port }}:{{ .Values.service.port }}

    curl http://localhost:{{ .Values.service.port }}

  {{/*
    Adjust as needed for your environment. If using Ingress or Gateway APIs,
    you may also show how to retrieve the external host or DNS.
  */}}
